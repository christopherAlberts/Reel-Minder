2. Sign up for a free account
3. Get your API key from the dashboard

### 2. Configure the API Key

#### For Local Development:
1. Open `config.js`
2. Replace `YOUR_NEWS_API_KEY_HERE` with your actual NewsAPI key:
```javascript
NEWS_API_KEY: 'your_actual_api_key_here',
```

#### For Production (Vercel/Netlify):
1. Add the environment variable `NEWS_API_KEY` to your deployment platform

### 3. Deploy the API Endpoints

#### For Vercel:
- The API endpoint is already created at `api/news.js`
- No additional configuration needed

#### For Netlify:
- The function is already created at `netlify/functions/news.js`
- No additional configuration needed

#### For Other Platforms:

## How It Works

### News Categories
- **All News**: General entertainment news
- **Movies**: Movie-specific news and updates
- **TV Shows**: Television and streaming content news
- **Celebrities**: Actor, director, and industry news

### Search Functionality
- Users can search for specific topics
- Search queries are sent to NewsAPI with entertainment-focused keywords
- Results are displayed in a responsive grid layout

### API Integration
- Uses NewsAPI's "everything" endpoint
- Automatically adds entertainment-related keywords to searches
- Handles CORS issues with serverless functions or proxy
- Includes error handling and loading states
