## Setup Instructions

### 1. Get TMDB API Key

1. Visit [The Movie Database (TMDB)](https://www.themoviedb.org/)
2. Create a free account
3. Go to [API Settings](https://www.themoviedb.org/settings/api)

### 2. Configure the Application

2. Open `config.js` in a text editor
3. Replace `'your_tmdb_api_key_here'` with your actual TMDB API key
4. Save the file

**Security Note**: The `config.js` file is included in `.gitignore` to prevent your API key from being committed to version control. This keeps your API key secure when sharing your code publicly.

### 3. Run the Application

1. Open `index.html` in your web browser
2. Start creating libraries and adding movies!

## How to Use

4. Edit or delete libraries as needed

### Sharing
- **Share Movies**: Click the share button on any movie
- **Share Libraries**: Click "Share" in the library view
- **Share Links**: Copy links to share with others

## Technical Details

- **Frontend**: Pure HTML, CSS, and JavaScript (no frameworks required)
- **API**: The Movie Database (TMDB) API for movie/TV data
- **Storage**: Browser localStorage for data persistence
- **Images**: TMDB image service for posters and backdrops
- **Trailers**: YouTube integration for trailer playback

## Browser Compatibility

- Chrome (recommended)
- Firefox
- Safari
- Edge
- Mobile browsers

## Data Storage

All your data is stored locally in your browser's localStorage. This means:
- ‚úÖ Your data stays private
- ‚úÖ No internet required after initial setup
- ‚ö†Ô∏è Data is tied to your browser/device
- ‚ö†Ô∏è Clearing browser data will remove your collections

## Troubleshooting

### Search Not Working
- Verify your TMDB API key is correctly set in `script.js`
- Check your internet connection
- Ensure the API key has proper permissions

### Images Not Loading
- This is usually due to TMDB's image service being temporarily unavailable
- The app will show placeholder images as fallback

### Sharing Not Working
- Make sure you're using HTTPS or localhost
- Some browsers may block sharing features on HTTP

## Future Enhancements

Potential features for future versions:
- User accounts and cloud sync
- Recommendations based on your preferences
- Integration with streaming services
- Export/import functionality
- Advanced filtering and sorting
